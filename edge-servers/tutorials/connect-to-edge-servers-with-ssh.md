# Connect to Edge Servers with SSH

## Introduction

Edge Servers are Linux-based virtual machines (VMs) that run on top of decentralised & virtualised hardware. Each Edge Server you create is a new server that you can use, either standalone or as part of a larger, cloud-based infrastructure.

## Tutorial

Edge Servers are managed using a terminal and SSH. You will need to have an SSH client and, optionally, an SSH key pair. Clients generally authenticate either using passwords (which are less secure and generally not recommended) or SSH keys (which are very secure and strongly recommended).

Most users connect to their Edge Servers using SSH and tools like Terminal on OSX or Putty on Windows, however you can also use the Edge Console built in to the account portal.

The Edge Account portal has a built in console for connecting to your Edge Server. You can use directly within your web browser.

To access the console, select the `console` tab from within your Edge Server's page in the account portal:

Next, click on the `Launch Console` button. This will open the console within the account portal:

You can now proceed to access your Edge Server using the default username and the password that was set at the point of Edge Server creation.
