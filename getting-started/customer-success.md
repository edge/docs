## Tinder

The worldâ€™s largest dating app with over 75 million monthly users, used Edge CDN to power its global Year In Swipeâ„¢ 2024 campaign.

The campaign platform featured interactive assets such as a personalised mood-board creating tool and city-level dating trends.

With a massive global audience and a need for real-time responsiveness, Tinder relied on Edge CDNâ€™s decentralised architecture â€” routing user requests through hundreds of nodes worldwide to serve each asset from the location closest to the user. This ensured consistently fast, reliable performance throughout the global campaign.

> In the first days alone, the interactive site drew over 35 million visits, peaking at 600 requests per second, and has now surpassed 82.7 million requests in total.&#x20;
>
> The Year In Swipeâ„¢ 2024 campaign earned a nomination for a Webby Award, placing it among the top 5 in its category worldwide.
