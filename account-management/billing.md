# Billing

## Introduction

Edge uses a prepaid wallet unique to each account for the handling of payment for service use. Before you can deploy services this wallet must be funded with a minimum of $5 (USD). Services automatically become available once your account's wallet has been funded.

## Tutorial

### Accessing the Billing Page

To access the billing page in your account, click the `Account` button top-right, and then click `Billing`:

Your billing page provides your `account details`, `referral code`, `transaction history`, `invoices` and the `ability to fund your account` directly using a credit card.
