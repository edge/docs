# Setting Up an Account

## Introduction

The Edge Account System is a completely anonymous and cryptographically secure environment. It gives you direct access to Edge Products & Services, including Edge Servers and Content Delivery, and is also used for billing and support.

## Tutorial

To set up an Edge account, head to te account portal:

{% embed url="https://account.edge.network/signin" %}

The account landing page gives you the option to sign in or to create a new account.

The account system uses a single cryptographic key for access. Make sure that you make a note of your key or store it in a password manager such as [1Password](https://1password.com).

You can optionally enable two factor authentication and/or a recovery email address at this stage. This can also be done later in the settings section of your account.

To go straight to your account click '`Go directly to my account`'. You are now signed in.
